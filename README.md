## Summary

I’m a Computer Engineer since 2011, but I started programming long time before that. I consider myself autodidact because I like to learn new technologies all the time and I can do it very quickly. I have started to study PHP at home since I was teenager, what give me good knowledge to develop many web applications. During the college and internships I learned other programming languages, such as C, C++, Java and Lua and I could improve myself with other skills.

I’ve been working for long time as a freelancer developer and most of the time involving web development, as a result I became an experienced web developer with big expertise in PHP, JavaScript, CSS and HTML. In the last few months I started working with Node.js and Golang.

I’ve already contributed in many open source projects like Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL), Zend Framework and other small JavaScript and Golang libraries. I like to work with open source projects and I do it in my spare time.

I worked in companies with several different technologies and it made me an open min- ded developer, with can-do attitude and a good interpersonal relationship. Currently I’m working with Golang as Full Stack Developer in south Brazil, but looking for new challenges around the world.
